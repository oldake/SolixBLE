App decoding
============

In order to fix protocol incompatibilities and/or add support for controlling a device, it may
be necessary to intercept the connection between the Anker app and the device. This allows for
analysis of what commands sent by the app do what, and how different devices negotiate.
How to perform this is covered in this section.


Requirements
------------

Device requirements:

- Android device with developer mode enabled.
- Anker app installed on the device.

Software requirements:

- `bash`
- `wget`
- `adb`
- `apktool`
- `java`
- `frida`


Patching
--------

In order to capture the messages sent between the phone and the device the app must be patched
to include `Frida <https://frida.re/>`_. Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit which allows
for us to `hook <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking>`_ functions, this is necessary to dump 
`shared preferences <https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences>`_, get logs of all packets sent and received, as well as providing us a view of
the `encryption functions <https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/Cipher>`_. Patching can be done `manually <https://koz.io/using-frida-on-android-without-root/>`_, 
using tools by `others <https://github.com/kiks7/frida-non-root/tree/master>`_ or the `patch.sh` 
script inside the scripts folder of the project repository.

.. note::
    If your device is rooted you can use `frida-server <https://deepwiki.com/frida/frida/3.4-frida-server-and-gadget>`_ instead of this approach.


patch.sh
^^^^^^^^

This script is provided to automate the process of patching the Anker app. It takes one 
argument which is the ID of the Android device with the Anker app installed
(e.g `192.168.1.1:1234`, `ABCDEF`, etc), and then automatically copies the Anker app from the
device, patches it, and installs the new patched version. It is designed to be called from
the scripts directory.

.. note::
    If you do not know the devices ID you can use `adb devices -l` to discover it.


This script performs the following actions:

1. Downloads (some) tools and dependencies needed to patch the app.
2. Downloads the installed Anker app from the connected Android device.
3. De-compiles/unpacks the Anker app.
4. Injects `Frida gadget <https://frida.re/docs/gadget/>`_ into the Anker apps files.
5. Modifies `AndroidManifest.xml` to support using Frida gadget.
6. Re-packages the APK.
7. Re-signs the APK.
8. Uninstalls the old Anker app.
9. Installs the patched Anker app.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./patch.sh 192.168.0.1:1234


.. note::
    The patched Anker app will not be usable for regular usage, it will only work 
    when Frida is being run to actively patch the app.


Using modified app
------------------

The modified app can be used with the Frida script to capture all Bluetooth 
packets, the encryption keys, shared preferences, and plain/cipher texts. 

The Anker app features a fairly robust anti-tamper mechanism which is non-trivial
to evade. Instead the Frida script disables the anti-tamper mechanisms ability 
to kill the app, this means you must execute the Frida script within at most
a second of opening the app.

To manually capture the logs follow these steps:

1. Port forward the port used by Frida gadget: 
   `adb -s <your device> forward tcp:49152 tcp:49152`.
2. Open the Anker app on the device.
3. Immediately execute: 
   `frida -H 127.0.0.1:49152 -n Gadget -l scripts/frida.js`.
4. The app will crash but Frida should remain open. 
5. Re-open the app on the device.
6. Perform the actions required to get the packets needed for analysis (add device, send commands, etc).

.. note::
    This process is incredibly time sensitive, it may take multiple attempts to get it right.


run.sh
^^^^^^

This script is provided to automate the steps required to use the modified app
and in addition writes the logs to a file as well as the console. This is 
the recommend approach.

.. note::
    The app must not be running when you start the script.

This script performs the following actions:

1. Starts the app.
2. Executes the frida.js script.
3. Waits 5 seconds and re-opens the app.

When the app has re-opened you should then perform the actions you wish to observe
the result of. If you wish to observe a negotiation you should connect 
to a new device in the Anker app, or if you wish to observe what bytes are
sent when you turn a switch on/off you should turn that switch on/off in the 
app and observe the log output. These log outputs can then be used to add 
equivalent functionality to this library, see :ref:`new device control <new_device_control>`
for more information.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./run.sh 192.168.0.1:1234

.. note::
    The script is more reliable than executing the steps by hand but still fails, it may be necessary to try several times.
